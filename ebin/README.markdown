edownload is a seqmented http file downloader

It downloads chunks of a file in parallel over http if the http server supports range requests.

I built it because I was tired of all the download managers dieing on my because of bad threading code.
And this problem seemed right up erlangs alley.

Now I just need to put a nice fancy frontend on it and I'll be ready to go :-)
